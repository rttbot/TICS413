% How to manage your references
%
% Decide what format this reference best fits into.
% i.e. Is it a book? A website? A news article? Conference proceedings? A journal article?
%
% Copy the correct format and replace the sample data with your reference's information
%
% Decide on the way to structure the keywords by which you cite these references, the part inside \cite{keywordHere}. I like to use the first author's name and the year. This is generally unique. Is citing lots of articles by the same set of authors the addition of a number or month could work well. Referencing tools may generate a unique number for each reference (such as 2649387-777), these are hard to remember I find, whereas the author's name and year helps you to recall what you are citing.
% i.e. lantair2019 or surnameThisyear
%
% Tips : Capitalisation in titles may be done by surrounding those letters to be upper case in {}, {T}itles {L}ook {N}ice {W}ith {C}apitals
%        Each author's name needs to be separated with the word and
%        More data is better than too little data
%        A reference per key point is decent
%        You're probably looking for ten quality, recent references for an ILM submission

title = "A market-based approach to the dynamic reconfiguration problem of service-based systems",
abstract = "Modern complex distributed systems are built as service-based systems (SBSs), composed of Web services, which are discovered and bound (most of the time) during runtime to handle the dynamic nature of Web service offerings. As far as vie know, all reconfiguration approaches assign to SBSs' owners the responsibility to identify, select and compose services that satisfy their reconfiguration needs. In practice, SBSs are not omniscient regarding potential service providers' partners or offer trade-offs; thus, in most (or all) cases, service compositions to reconfigure SBSs are suboptimal. This article describes the market-based service reconfiguration (MBSR) approach, where service providers and requesters are software agents and reconfigurations naturally arise from the interaction of them. We implement MACOCO++, a multi-agent reference implementation to configure and reconfigure SBSs; the studied SBSs yield systematically better reconfigurations, and the prototype scales up well regarding both, complexity and number of concurrent service requests. Our results show that using an agent-based market metaphor yields better, fairer service agreements for requesters without needing a central (and possibly unfeasible) component with global knowledge.",

title = "Building an IoT-aware healthcare monitoring system",
abstract = "Nowadays, ageing related diseases represent one of the most relevant challenges for developed countries. The use of healthcare remote technology may allow reducing most of the management of the chronic diseases meanwhile it may also contribute to the improvement of elderly people's quality of life. Unfortunately, despite the advent of Internet of things and the even decreasing price of sensors, current proposals are not extensible during runtime meaning that they need to be maintained offline by engineers. Therefore, in this paper we discuss how to build an ad-hoc extensible (during runtime) healthcare monitoring system by using low cost wireless sensors and already existent Internet of things technology as communication platform. Moreover, we present a prototype of a basic healthcare remote monitoring system, which alerts, in real time, patients' relatives or medical doctors that an elderly people is experienced a problem that could need medical attention or hospitalization.",

abstract = {Nowadays, there are several effective computational intelligence techniques that, theoretically, could be useful to classify human daily life actions. Moreover, sensors are getting smaller, cheaper, portable and even wearable. In this paper, we have built an annotation tool by applying several computational intelligence techniques (K-Nearest Neighbor, the Support Vector Machine and the Multilayer Perceptron) to detect six types of human actions in daily life based on signals obtained from an accelerometer sensor (standing-up, walking, running, resting, jumping and sitting-down) with an accuracy over 85\%. In the future, this component will be the base to infer abnormal behavior from common daily behavior that could be an emergency situation in evolution.},
